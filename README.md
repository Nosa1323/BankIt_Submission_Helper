# BankIt_Submission_Helper
This script helps to correct the format of the features for BankIt submission.

BankIt accepts features as a five-column, tab-delimited table file. The feature table specifies the location and type of each feature, and BankIt processes the feature intervals and translates any CDS features into proteins.
